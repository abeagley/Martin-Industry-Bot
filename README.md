# EE-Industry-Bot
## Creating a discord bot that handles Eve Echoes Corporation industry needs

###Introduction
The aim of EE-Industry-Bot is to make industrial transactions for a corporation in the game Eve Echoes easier for players.
The bot began simply as a way to calculate the amount owed when selling ore but has now expanded to more roles such as selling planetary resources, ordering materials, and storing this data in a database.

###Tech
EE-Industry-Bot currently uses:
*Javascript
*Node.js
*Heroku
*MongoDB

###Setup(Not currently available)
Currently the bot is hosted on heroku which reads this repo and when the repo is updated, the bot is updated. 
It currently also uses stored data from MongoDB and writes to MongoDB. 
I am yet to rebuild the bot for it to be re-usable for other corps.
